                    <p>Hi, I'm Betel Bisrat, a <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Computer Science</b></span> student at <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Carleton University</b></span>, 
                       with a stream in <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b></span>, and a minor in <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Psychology</b></span>. My
                       academic journey is complemented by a passion for personal projects
                       where I continuously apply and expand my knowledge in the field.<br><br>

                       I've developed proficiency in various programming languages and
                       technologies, including <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C</b></span> and 
                       database management with such as <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>SQL</b></span>. My development 
                       environment is diverse, covering both <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Linux </b></span> and <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"> <b>Windows</b></span> platforms, and  
                       I'm proficient in using tools like <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>Visual Studio Code</b></span> and <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"> <b>IntelliJ</b></span>, along with version
                       control systems such as <span style="color: rgb(192, 213, 194);"><b>GitHub/Git</b></span>.<br><br>

                      Additionally, I have a keen interest in expanding my knowledge, 
                      especially in areas that spark my curiosity, through YouTube videos and earning 
                      certifications.<br><br>
                      
                      As I continue to grow and learn in this dynamic field, I am eager to apply 
                      my skills and knowledge in practical settings. I'm committed to contributing 
                      innovative solutions to complex challenges and solving problems in the field of

                            In September 2023, the second edition of "Freedom" 
                            was published, featuring revisions, enhancements,

                            I published my first book, "Freedom," 
                            with Ukiyoto Publishing. This collection 
                            of poetry delves into various themes, such as culture, 
                            freedom, and self-discovery. </li>
