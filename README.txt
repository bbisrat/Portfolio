NOTE (for when you open it next time):
- The trastion from one button? to another isn't working.
    -e.g., publication to volunteer, in the about page
- fix my picture size in the about page
- color of the description in about has to be changed

PLAN:
- To put all the other info/ pages that isn't in the home page
    -Put them all in one page just one after the other
